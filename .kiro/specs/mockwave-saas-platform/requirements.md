# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Apiwave is a SaaS platform that enables users to generate complete backend projects and APIs instantly using Large Language Model (LLM) technology. The platform accepts various input formats (natural language, YAML, JSON, or visual wizard) and leverages DeepSeek Coder V2 to automatically generate tailored backend projects with endpoints, authentication, mocks, testing, and environment configuration. Users can preview generated projects interactively, deploy to cloud services, and manage their projects through OAuth-secured accounts with tiered subscription features.

## Glossary

- **Apiwave_Platform**: The complete SaaS web application system
- **LLM_Service**: The Large Language Model integration service using DeepSeek Coder V2
- **Backend_Generator**: The component that creates complete backend projects
- **Interactive_Preview**: Live, browsable API endpoint mockup and codebase viewer
- **OAuth_System**: Third-party authentication integration system
- **Cloud_Deployment_Service**: Integration service for provisioning to cloud providers
- **Subscription_Manager**: Component managing user tiers and premium features
- **Project_Repository**: Storage system for user-created projects

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input API descriptions in multiple formats, so that I can quickly generate backend projects regardless of my preferred specification method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an API description via natural language input, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL accept and process the description through the LLM_Service
2. WHEN a user uploads a YAML specification file, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL parse and validate the YAML format before processing
3. WHEN a user uploads a JSON specification file, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL parse and validate the JSON format before processing
4. WHEN a user completes the visual wizard interface, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL convert the wizard inputs into a structured specification
5. WHERE multiple input formats are provided simultaneously, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL prioritize the most recently submitted format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate complete backend projects, so that I can save time on boilerplate code and focus on business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an API description, THE Backend_Generator SHALL leverage the LLM_Service to interpret the specification and generate a complete backend project
2. THE Backend_Generator SHALL include API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, mock data, testing frameworks, and environment configuration in every generated project
3. WHEN generation is complete, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL provide the generated codebase within 60 seconds of submission
4. THE Backend_Generator SHALL support common backend frameworks and programming languages as determined by the LLM_Service analysis
5. IF generation fails, THEN THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested corrections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview generated backends interactively, so that I can validate the generated code before deployment or download.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a preview of a generated project, THE Interactive_Preview SHALL display a live, browsable API endpoint mockup
2. THE Interactive_Preview SHALL allow users to test API endpoints with sample requests and view responses
3. THE Interactive_Preview SHALL provide a browsable codebase viewer with syntax highlighting
4. WHEN users interact with preview endpoints, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL return realistic mock responses based on the generated specifications
5. THE Interactive_Preview SHALL update in real-time when users modify project specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate via OAuth and manage my projects securely, so that I can save, edit, and share my generated backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates login, THE OAuth_System SHALL provide authentication options through supported third-party providers
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL create or retrieve the user's account and project workspace
3. THE Project_Repository SHALL allow authenticated users to save, edit, and delete their generated projects
4. WHEN a user shares a project, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL generate secure sharing links with appropriate access controls
5. THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL maintain project version history for authenticated users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to deploy generated backends to cloud services with one click, so that I can quickly move from prototype to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the deploy option, THE Cloud_Deployment_Service SHALL present available integrated cloud providers
2. WHEN a user confirms deployment, THE Cloud_Deployment_Service SHALL provision the generated backend to the selected cloud provider within 5 minutes
3. THE Cloud_Deployment_Service SHALL provide deployment status updates and completion notifications
4. WHEN deployment is complete, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL provide the deployed backend URL and access credentials
5. IF deployment fails, THEN THE Cloud_Deployment_Service SHALL provide detailed error logs and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to premium features based on my subscription tier, so that I can unlock advanced functionality as my needs grow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with a premium subscription requests advanced authentication features, THE Subscription_Manager SHALL unlock enhanced authentication options
2. WHEN a user with a premium subscription requests analytics features, THE Subscription_Manager SHALL provide access to usage analytics and monitoring tools
3. WHEN a user with a premium subscription requests integrations, THE Subscription_Manager SHALL enable third-party service integrations
4. THE Subscription_Manager SHALL enforce usage limits based on the user's current subscription tier
5. WHEN a user exceeds their tier limits, THE Apiwave_Platform SHALL prompt for subscription upgrade options
